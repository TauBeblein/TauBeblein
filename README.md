Hi, Iâ€™m @TauBeblein

My primary focus since 2003 have been Java development and in that time I have worked with most parts of the J2EE platform.
As an architect I have worked on Logistic, CRM and self-service applications and followed the process from analysis to implementation. 
Primarily, I am a Java Developer and I love my work.

My time is a little packed, so threre is lots I like to do, but little that end up here...

Regards,
@TauBeblein
